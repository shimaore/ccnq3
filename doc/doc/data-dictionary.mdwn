Notes:
* URI of databases = URI of CouchDB databases (always a string).
  These URIs might contain authentication usernames and passwords.

# provisioning database

The provisioning database contains the master copy of all provisioning information
for an entire system.
It contains different types of records, which can be identified by their "type" field.
The type is also the first part of the records' identifier, to avoid collisions.

## host (aka config) provisioning records

There must be exactly one "host" record for each server in the system.

Most changes in this type of records might require you to:

  * either restart the ccnq3 processes to apply the changes:

      /etc/init.d/ccnq3 restart

    (This should be sufficient in most cases.)

  * in some cases reinstall the ccnq3 package:

      aptitude reinstall ccnq3

    This is especially true when adding an application, so that
    the proper dependencies might be installed for the new application.

However this does not apply to commands (such as the ones in "sip_commands"),
which are executed immediately.

Please note that restarting, reinstalling, or submitting commands in a lot of
cases will cause calls to disconnect. These operations are best used during
dedicated maintenance windows and should be avoided during production use.

Currently the main freeswitch, opensips, and medaproxy processes are not started by ccnq3.
These processes might be controlled using their respective /etc/init.d/ scripts.

### Common section (host provisioning record)

All the fields in this section are pre-populated by the various scripts.
There is no reason to change them after the initial installation of a server.
Only the "applications" array will need to be expanded.
(This can be easily done using the web portal.)

Caveat: provisioning.host_couchdb_uri might need to be fixed if the system cannot guess
your installation.

    _id: type+":"+host
    account: ""    (the empty string)
    updated_at: integer, update timestamp in ms [required]
      Note: new Date().getTime()  for example

    type:"host"
    host: string; hostname, preferably FQDN (must match what the "hostname" command returns)

    interfaces: {} of {}, fields:
      ipv4: IP (if interface is v4)
      ipv6: IP (if interface is v6)
      Note: the name of the records must be unique, so they cannot just be the interface's name.
    interfaces.primary.ipv4
    interfaces.primary.ipv6
      If present, these are selected as the addresses for the host itself.
      Otherwise a random non-private IPv4 address is selected, and a
      random IPv6 address is selected, from the ones present in the
      "interfaces" records.

    # Note: Changing any of the following settings would require to restart the matching
    #       services, since configuration is read (in most cases) once at startup.

    admin:   (only present for bootstrap-system hosts normally; there's no reason to modify these)
      couchdb_uri: server admin URI
      system: true   (indicates this host is the one that should do system updates)

    applications: [] of strings, list of applications that need to be installed
      Note: these are simply relative paths to the matching "package" for that application.
      Note: to apply changes to the list of applications, you must "aptitude reinstall ccnq3" on the host.
      Example:   [ "applications/host", "applications/traces", "applications/freeswitch" ]

    usercode:
      couchdb_uri: URI of the usercode database (with database admin authentication) [used by couchapps to install their applications]

    provisioning:
      couchdb_uri: URI of the provisioning database (with database admin authentication) [used by couchapps apps to insert new applications]
        Note: normally only present on a manager host (and only used by installation scripts)
      host_couchdb_uri: URI of the provisioning database (read-only) [allows access to the main provisioning database from any host]
        Note: this URI is used as the source for replication of the provisioning database onto a non-manager host
              Replication will work better if this URI points directly to CouchDB (rather than a reverse proxy, for example).
        Note: this URI is also used by ccnq3_config to locate the host's configuration; if it is not present only the local (file-based) configuration will be used.
      local_couchdb_uri: URI of a local replica of the provisioning database [used by local applications such as opensips]
        Note: generally http://127.0.0.1:5984/provisioning [no authentication to keep things faster]
        Note: realtime (call-handling) applications should only rely on this database as their primary source
        Note: must have db admin access to the database (so that applications can push their design documents)


    install: (normally not defined)
      # This feature is used to force re-installation of the corresponding databases (for example to change the URI)
      usercode:
        couchdb_uri
      provisioning:
        couchdb_uri
      users:
        couchdb_uri

### Specific to hosts running FreeSwitch.

To add a FreeSwitch host:

1. configure the fields in this section
   (You'll need to configure at least "sip_domain_name".)
   (You'll need to configure one sip_profiles[] in order to be able to place calls.)
2. add "applications/freeswitch" to the applications field [and restart ccnq3]


    sip_domain_name:  string (required); FQDN accepted by the server
      Note: this should be the "cluster name" for servers running similar
        configurations. This is used by applications/dns to create
        SRV records for these services. This is also used by applications/opensips
        to create gateway entries for the egress_gwid in those domains/clusters.
        Finally, this is the domain name accepted by OpenSIPS servers in that cluster.
    rtp_ip: local IP to bind to for RTP [default: "auto"]
    cdr_aggregate_uri: URI where the local CDRs should be replicated to [no default]
    sip_profiles: {} of profiles descriptions:

        sip_profiles[profile_name]:

          # Sofia data
          template: sofia template name (e.g. "sbc-media", "sbc-nomedia")
          # For the "sbc*" types, we need:
          ingress_sip_ip: which IP (v4,v6) to bind for ingress processing
          ingress_sip_port: which port to bind for ingress processing [in the range 5060 to 5299]
          ingress_acl: [] of CIDR records "ip/masklen" source IPs allowed for ingress processing
          egress_sip_ip: which IP (v4,v6) to bind for egress processing [default: ingress_sip_ip]
          egress_sip_port: which port to bind for egress processing [default: 10000+ingress_sip_port; in the range 15060 to 15299]
          egress_acl: [] of CIDR records "ip/masklen" source IPs allowed for the egress processing
          egress_gwid: integer, optional; a (unique) gateway id to be used in routing rules

            Note: port numbers must be in the range 5060 to 5299 or 15060 to 15299 to be compatible with the "traces" application.
            Note: look in doc/doc/port-numbers.mdwn for port numbers conventions.
            Note: egress_gwid must be unique amongst all gateway IDs, including the ones in "gateway"-type records.

          # Dialplan data
          handler: dialplan template name (e.g. "client-sbc", "voicemail")
          egress_target: domain where to send egress calls

          # For handler="client-sbc"
          type: dialplan profile type (e.g. "usa", "france")
          send_call_to: where to send the calls ("socket", "bridge") [default: "socket"]
          ingress_target: domain where to send ingress calls

          # For handler on one of the carrier-sbc's
          enum_root: Carrier ENUM root for inbound routing

          # For handler="voicemail"
          default_language: string; default voicemail language [default: this host's voicemail.default_language, see below]

      Notes: changes (except for *_sip_ip and *_sip_port) are automatically applied.

    sip_commands: {} of profiles commands:

        sip_commands[sofia_profile]: string
          One of:
            "start"       sofia profile <profile_name> start
            "restart"     sofia profile <profile_name> restart reloadxml  [required to change IP or port]
            "stop"        sofia profile <profile_name> killgw

        sip_commands.freeswitch: string
          One of:
            "reload sofia"    unload mod_sofia, load mod_sofia            [required to add a new profile]
            "pause inbound"   fsctl pause inbound
            "pause outbound"  fsctl pause outbound
            "resume inbound"  fsctl resume inbound
            "resume outbound" fsctl resume outbound

        Note: All these commands will cause calls to drop if any is present on that profile.
        Note: The "sofia_profile" key is either "egress-#{profile_name}" or "ingress-#{profile_name}" so that each direction
              can be restarted independently.
        Note: Add a command then remove it from the hash to prevent accidental misfiring of commands.
        Note: A special "sofia_profile" key "opensips" is used to send events to a running OpenSIPS process (rather than a
              FreeSwitch sofia profile). See below for more information.
        Note: A special "sofia_profile" key "registrant" is used to send events to a running registrant process (rather than a
              FreeSwitch sofia profile). See below for more information.

    sip_variables: {} of global (FreeSwitch) variables; defaults to {}
        Note: The idea is that these can be used on a per-host basis by additional dialplans, profiles, etc.
        Note: These should also show up in CDRs. FIXME confirm this is the case

### Specific to hosts running OpenSIPS.

To add an OpenSIPS host:

1. configure the fields in this section
2. add "applications/opensips" to the applications field [and restart ccnq3]
3. run common/mediaproxy/install.sh to install mediaproxy FIXME still requires some work


    opensips_proxy:
      port:34340   integer, required, do not change [default]
      hostname:"127.0.0.1"   string, required, do not change [default]
      usrloc_uri: URI of the location database (used to save registration data)
        Note: this should be "http://127.0.0.1:5984/location" [default]
      usrloc_aggregate_uri: URI where the location database should be replicated to [no default]

    opensips:
      model: "complete", or any other model defined in common/opensips [required]
      number_domain: string; a domain used to identify local numbers [default: "local"]
        Note: you might think of it as a dialplan name, as well.
      listen: [] of strings "host:port" to which OpenSIPS will bind()  [default is the empty array, in which case OpenSIPS binds to all interfaces on port 5060]
      local_ipv4: for models using it ("conference"), IP where to send all INVITE messages
      local_ipv6: reserved

      voicemail_notifier: incoming SUBSCRIBE messages are sent to this host:port or name
        Note: typically should point to the egress-* voicemail profile's NAPTR record.
        Note: if this parameter is not defined, forwarding of message waiting indication (MWI) via SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY messages will not work.

    sip_commands.opensips: string
      One of:
        "reload routes"         [apply "rule" or "gateway" record changes]

### Specific to hosts running the portal (or its back-end).

To enable the portal service:

1. configure the fields in this section
2. add "applications/portal" to the applications field [and restart ccqn3]

Note: this service is enabled by default on the manager host.
You should not have to modify these settings.


    portal:
      port: integer (8765)
      hostname:  string ("127.0.0.1")
    session:
      secret:  string; must be a random string
      couchdb_uri:  public URI used to create CouchDB sessions (must end with "/_session"; no authentication in the URI)
    users:
      couchdb_uri: URI of the _users database (with database admin authentication)
      replicate_uri: URI for "/_replicate" (with database admin authentication)
      userdb_base_uri: base URI of the various users' databases (with server admin authentication, used to create the databases)
      public_userdb_base_uri: public base URI of the various users' databases (no authentication! given out to the users)
    mailer:     Used as the configuration for the node-mailer package.
      sendmail: "/usr/sbin/sendmail"
      SMTP: null
        Note: this is required for applications/portal and applications/voicemail to send out email notifications.
    mail_password:
      sender_local_part: "support"; The mail_password agent will send emails from  sender_local_part+"@"+domain (where domain is the user's record's "domain" field).
      file_base: string; a prefix used to locate the format files used by the email notifier.
        Note: On Unix the string must finish with a slash.
        Note: The notifier will try to append "portal_password.subject", "portal_password.body", "portal_password.html" to compose the email subject, text body and HTML body, respectively. If one of the files is missing, a default is used.
        Note: The files must contain Milk templates. The template will receive in particular the following parameters:
          domain: the web domain used to create the account
          name: the username
          password: the password

    Note: "host" records are referred to as the "config" record inside most applications.

### Specific to hosts running SIP traces.

To start traces:

1. install the ccnq3-traces package
2. configure the fields in this section
3. add "applications/traces" to the applications field
4. make sure users who need to run traces have the "access:traces:" role.

Note: this is not enabled by default even after you install the ccnq3-traces package.


    traces:
      interfaces: [] of interfaces names
      # There's no reason to modify the following parameters for traces.
      filesize: integer, maximum size of the sniffer traces (in ko), defaults to 10000
      ringsize: integer, maximum number of sniffer trace files, defaults to 50
      workdir: string, directory used to store the traces, defaults to /opt/ccnq3/traces
      filter: string, pcap filter for traces, defaults to ports used by ccnq3 applications

      run: {} of traces to run; the index is the TCP port number; content:
          to_user     string; To username (destination number)
          from_user   string; From username (calling number)
          call_id     string; Call-ID
          days_ago    integer; only lookup for this number of days ago (0 = today)
          format      string; either 'pcap' or 'json'

        Note: for each entry, a single-shot web server will be started on the specified port number.
          That server will send back either a JSON or a PCAP document which will contain packets found
          in the available trace files on the server.
          (Since the trace files are rotated to not exceed a given disk space, it is possible that a
          trace might not be found even though a call was placed.)

        Note: the JSON ouput is an array of hash record; the records might contain the following fields:
            "frame.time"
            "ip.version"
            "ip.dsfield.dscp"
            "ip.src"
            "ip.dst"
            "ip.proto"
            "udp.srcport"
            "udp.dstport"
            "sip.Call-ID"
            "sip.Request-Line"
            "sip.Method"
            "sip.r-uri.user"
            "sip.r-uri.host"
            "sip.r-uri.port"
            "sip.Status-Line"
            "sip.Status-Code"
            "sip.to.user"
            "sip.from.user"
            "sip.From"
            "sip.To"
            "sip.contact.addr"
            "sip.User-Agent"
        Note: to obtain the complete data use the PCAP download.

        Note: this type of request is highly CPU intensive for the target host.
          It is only meant as a troubleshooting tool for administrators, not as a generically available service.
          Use the cdr database to obtain per-call information as a generic service.

### Specific to hosts running as registrants.

Related: applications/registrant

    registrant:
      local_ipv4: string, IP where to send incoming calls
      local_port: integer, port where to send incoming calls
      remote_ipv4: string, upstream registrar
      proxy_port: integer, the port for this SIP service [default: 5070]

    sip_commands.registrant: string
      One of:
        "start"           Start the registrant server.
        "stop"            Stop the registrant server.

    Note: registrant entries (generated by using the "registrant_password" field in global numbers records) are
          pushed into the registrant's process configuration as they appear; however they are not applied until
          a "restart" command is issued.

#### Specific to hosts running as emergency servers.

Related: applications/emergency

    emergency: {}
      Note: the configuration hash may be empty, but needs to be present for the service to start.
      proxy_port: integer, the port for this SIP service [default: 5072]

    sip_commands.emergency: string
      One of:
        "start"           Start the emergency server.
        "stop"            Stop the emergency server.

### Specific to hosts running voicemail

Voicemail is stored inside a user's own CouchDB database.
This section specifies the parameters for applications/voicemail.

    voicemail:
      userdb_base_uri: string, required; the URI prefix (including authentication for the "voicemail manager") to a user's database
      port: integer, optional; the (local) port for the voicemail ESL server [default: 7123]
      min_duration: integer, optional; the minimal duration for a voicemail fragment [default: 5]
      max_duration: integer, optional; the maximal duration for a voicemail fragment [default: 300]
      default_language: language used if none is specified in the sip_profile [default: 'en']
      number_domain: string; a domain used to identify local numbers [default: "local"]
      record_streaming: boolean; if true stream recording of messages (only available with non-encapsulated formats such as "PCMU") [default: false]
        Note: if false messages are first recorded on the local server then uploaded to the message store
      playback_streaming: boolean; if true stream playback of messages [default: true]
      format: string; voicemail message format [default: "wav"]
        Note: see http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod_native_file for an explanation; meaningul values would be "PCMU" or "PCMA" in most cases.
      max_parts: integer; the maximum number of segments/parts that might be recorded in a voicemail message [default: 1]
      sender: string; the email address used to send email notifications from, if none is specified for a number.
      file_base: string; a prefix used to locate the format files used by the email notifier.
        Note: On Unix this string must be terminated by a slash.
        Note: The notifier will attempt to append "voicemail_notification" or "voicemail_notification_with_attachment", then the user's language, then the component of the email message (subject, text body, or HTML body) and locate the appropriate files.
          For example, for a notification without attachment using language 'en' the following suffix will be used:
            voicemail_notification.en.subject, voicemail_notification.en.body, voicemail_notification.en.html
        Note: If present, the content of those files will be used as Milk templates. The parameters will consist of the content of the voicemail message record. Especially the following parameters are available:
          caller_id
          timestamp
        (See the "voicemail records" section below.)

      callback:  Configuration to allow users to call the number that left a voicemail message
        profile   "ingress-#{profile_name}" or "egress-#{profile_name}"
        domain    the domain name where the message should be sent to
        Note: if sending to a proxy, make sure the voicemail server has a matching endpoint record with "sbc" set to type 10 so that it is authorized to pass charging information along.


### Other data in a "host" provisioning record.

### Attachments

Attachments of type "application/javascript" are executed after each change.
The attachments might use any core Node.js modules.

FIXME test this feature

## domain (provisioning records)

These records are normally used to populate the DNS server ("applications/dns").

Alternatively, if "support_alternate_domains" is enabled in the OpenSIPS configuration,
an OpenSIPS server will accept any domain listed here.
(By default only sip_domain_name is accepted.)

    _id: type+":"+domain
    account: ""    (the empty string)

    type:"domain"
    domain: string; the name of the DNS domain

### ccnq3-dns service

  If "applications/dns" is configured on the host, "domain" provisioning records may be used to populate DNS records.
  In this case the "account" field is optional (which can only be done on the main provisioning database).
  The following fields are available:

    ENUM: boolean; true if the domain is to be used to provide "number"-type records as a Carrier ENUM service
    ttl: integer, time-to-live for the records
      Note: should be short for an ENUM domain.
    admin: optional string, the contact value of the domain's SOA [default: "hostmaster."+domain]
    records: [] of {}; the fields of the records are as follows:
      prefix: a prefix to the domain (local name) [optional]
      ttl: integer, individual record's ttl [overrides domain's default]
      class: "A", "NS", etc. [default: "A"] (only "IN" classes are supported)
      value: either a string (if only one value is provided, for example for A, CNAME, NS, etc.), or an array of response values.
        An array value is used for example for SRV records or NAPTR records.

      Example:
        records: [
          {class:'NS', value:'ns1.example.net.'}
          {class:'NS', value:'ns2.example.net.'}
          {prefix:'s1',value:'192.168.1.10'}
          {prefix:'_sip._udp',class:'SRV',value:[20,7,5060,"sip1.example.net."]}
          {class:"NAPTR",value:[20,10,'u','E2U+sip',"!^.*$!sip:foo@example.net!", ""]

        ]

  Note: "applications/dns" runs on port 53053. To allow remote hosts to access the application on port 53, install the ccnq3-dns package.

## account_forwarder (provisioning records)

For non-trusted host that are allowed to submit P-Charge-Info, list of accounts they may submit.

    _id: type+":"+account+'@'+endpoint
    account: account

    type:"account_forwarder"
    endpoint: endpoint

## endpoint (provisioning records)

    _id: type+":"+endpoint
    account: string

    type:"endpoint"
    endpoint: string, required; either a static IP, or a user@domain registration username
      Note: If a static IP, it must be identical to the user_ip field.
      Note: If a registration endpoint, password, ha1, and ha1b are required.

    ### Registration endpoint:
    password: string; password used for authentication, or null if authentication not used
    ha1: authentication string; hex_md5([username,challenge,password].join(":"))
    ha1b: authentication string; hex_md5([username+'@'+challenge,challenge,password].join(":"))
      Note: if the "challenge" configuration parameter is empty (the default), the domain name of the To: header (for REGISTER) or From: header (for other messages) is used as the challenge. In other words: normally the challenge should be the same as the domain name used for the endpoint.

    ### Static endpoint:
    user_ip         string  Static endpoint's IP address [required for static endpoints]
      Note: must be identical to the endpoint field if used.
    user_port       integer Static endpoint's port number [optional]
    disabled        boolean If true, this IP is prevented from talking to the switch.
      Note: used to build a black-list of IP addresses.

    ### Inbound call routing (dst_endpoint)
    dest_domain     string  Override the destination domain with this value
      Note: overrides user_srv and user_via
      Note: probably obsolete
    dst_disabled    boolean If true, calls towards this endpoint are blocked
    strip_digit     boolean If true, remove the first digit of the destination username
    user_force_mp   boolean If true, attempt to force media_proxy insertion
    user_srv        string  Final user's domain (compatible with user_via)
    user_via        string  If present, calls are routed via this SBC
      Note: this requires a type of SBC which has not yet been ported to ccnq3.

    ### Outbound call routing (src_endpoint)
    dialog_timer: integer; maximum call (dialog) duration (in seconds)
    outbound_route: integer; route to use for outbound calls from this endpoint; if null, per-number outbound_route is used

    check_from      boolean If true, the call can only be placed if the endpoint for the number is the same as this endpoint. (Allows to restrict which caller_id is presented by an endpoint.)
    dest_domain     string  Override the destination domain
    sbc             integer This endpoint is an outbound SBC that sends calls to us towards a carrier.
      # Our own outbound SBCs
       1 SBC provides originator endpoint information as Sock-Info or source RURI param [outbound]
       2 SBC provides account info in P-Charge-Info (no checks) [outbound] (for example, a client-sbc)
      # Customer (outbound) SBCs
      10 SBC provides account info in P-Charge-Info, account is checked against account_forwarder [outbound]
    inbound_sbc     integer This endpoint is an inbound SBC that sends calls to us from a carrier.
      # Inbound SBCs
       1 upstream SBC [inbound]

    location        string  An identifier for a location record
      Note: might be overriden by the calling number's location.
    outbound_route  integer An identifier for a rule record's group_id
    src_disabled    boolean All outbound calls are disabled.
      Note: Use outbound_route to allow some calls (e.g. emergency) and reject others.
    user_force_mp   boolean If true, attempt to force media_proxy insertion

    allow_onnet     boolean Obsolete; ccnq3 is not designed for allow_onnet.
      Note: For allow_onnet to work you need to create separate "number" records for the client-side numbers so that the local OpenSIPS knows how to route them.
            Routing can be done via a CFA, pointing e.g. to the ingress side of an open (inbound) carrier-sbc.
      Note: Support for this feature might be removed at any time, do not depend on it.

    emergency_domain: string
      Note: This domain is used when an outbound-proxy sends a query to an emergency server.
        The emergency server will use this domain in its 302 Redirect response to the outbound-proxy.


## number (provisioning records)

    _id: type+":"+number
    account: string [required]

    type:"number"
    number: string
      For global numbers (between a carrier-sbc and a client-sbc), formatted as "E.164-without-plus".
      For client-side local-numbers, a locally-formatted number @ the server's "number_domain".

    # Global-number properties:
    inbound_uri: string (URI)  a URI used by an outbound-proxy to bypass LCR and route a number directly, or an inbound Carrier SBC to route the number.
      Note: these are used to build Carrier ENUM records.
    outbound_route: integer; allows to select a specific rule based on the rule's groupid

    registrant_password: password for applications/registrant
      Note: you must issue a "restart" registrant command for the changes to be applied.
    # FIXME: need registrant_sip_domain

    # Local-number properties:
    endpoint [required]
    location:  string; the location identifier for this specific number (used for emergency location services)
      Note: if present, overrides the endpoint's location.
    cfa:  string, URI; if present, all calls are forwarded to this URI
    cfb:  string, URI; if present, busy calls are forwarded to this URI
    cfda: string, URI; if present, unanswered calls are forwarded to this URI
    cfnr: string, URI; if present, non-registered endpoints are forwarded to this URI
    dialog_timer: integer; maximum call duration
    inv_timer: integer; maximum ringback duration

    privacy: boolean
      if true, a Privacy: id (mask calling number) header is added to outbound calls
    asserted_number: string
      if present, a P-Asserted-Identity (Caller-ID) header is added to outbound calls

    reject_anonymous: boolean
      if true, reject anonymous inbound calls
    use_blacklist: boolean
      if true, reject inbound calls from the blacklist
    use_whitelist: boolean
      if true, reject inbound calls from the whitelist

    user_database:  string; the name of the user's own CouchDB instance (for the user who "owns" this number)
      Note: this is used by the voicemail system to locate the voicemail_settings record and record or playback voicemail
      messages.

    voicemail_sender: string; the email address used to send out voicemail notifications for this number
      Note: if not present, the "voicemail.sender" configuration parameter of the host running voicemail is used.
        If neither are present, the recipient's email address is used as as stop-gap.

## whitelist/blacklist (provisioning records)

A local number may reject or accept calls from specific numbers.

    _id: type+':'+number+'@'+calling_number
    type: 'list'
    number: string; a local number '@' number_domain
    calling_number: string; a locally-formatted calling number

    blacklist: boolean
    whitelist: boolean
      must be true for the action to be taken

## rule (aka outbound_route) (provisioning records)

    _id: type+":"+rule
    account: ""    (the empty string)

    type:"rule"
    rule: host+":"+ruleid
    host: the host on which OpenSIPS is running and using this rule/outbound_route
    ruleid: integer; a unique ID for this rule (a sequential or random number)
      Note: the ruleid is used rather than a longer, composed key, which should have groupid, prefix, timerec, and priority.

The following four fields are used to select a rule.
The set of applicable rules is narrowed down as each field is applied in order.

    groupid: integer; this is the "outbound_route" of the endpoint (or of the the number, if the endpoint does not provide an "outbound_route")
      Note: although it seems OpenSIPS might support having one or more groupid for a given rule we currently do not support this option.
    prefix: string; the routing (destination number) prefix (might be ""), longest-prefix match
    timerec: string; a time specification
    priority: integer; ruleset ordering criteria (within the groupid and prefix, for matching timerecs, the rule with the highest priority is chosen)

At the end of the selection process, only one rule is selected.

The following fields are the output of the selection process, and
are used to route the call, once a rule has been selected.

The gateway list indicates which gateways (either "gateway" records or "egress_gwid" sip_profiles)
are used to route the call.

    gwlist: string; a comma- and semicolon-separated list of gateways

The following two (output) fields are required even though they are not currently used.

    routeid: 0   (the integer 0)
    attrs: ""
      The "attrs" field is present in the call CDR as "ccnq_attrs" on outbound calls.

    Note: For the complete specification, see http://www.opensips.org/html/docs/modules/1.7.x/drouting.html#id293582

    Note: We use sort_order = 1, meaning that inside gwlist each semicolon delimits a group of gateways; each group contains a comma-delimited list of gateways. For each call, two gateways are selected at random in each group (groups are kept in the order they appear), and the call is then sequantially forked to each gateway.

Note: Changes to rules and gateways are not applied automatically. Use sip_commands.opensips = "reload routes" (or the equivalent portal action) to apply the changes.

## emergency(provisioning records)

This is currently used to implement a French emergency call router.

The trigger (destination) number uses the format: number#routing_data

  _id: type + ":" + number + "#" + routing_data
  type: "emergency"
  number: string; [for example local number "112", or global number "330112"]
  routing_data: string, matching the routing_data field of the location record.
    Note: In France this would be the INSEE code of the commune.

  destination: string; a target phone number expressed in the emergency_domain of the server that sent the request.
    Note: this means that the Contact URI returned in the 302 message will consist of destination@emergency_domain.

## gateway (provisioning records)

    _id: type+":"+gateway
    account: ""    (the empty string)

    type:"gateway"
    gateway: sip_domain_name+":"+gwid
    sip_domain_name: the sip_domain_name of the hosts on which OpenSIPS is running and using this gateway
    gwid: integer; a unique identifier for the gateway inside this sip_domain_name; used in the "gwlist" field of the "rule" record

    address: the address of the gateway (IP, IP:port, etc.)

    # The following fields are required even though they are not currently used.
    gwtype: 0   (the integer 0)

    # The following fields are required, and might be used at your convenience, although we only test the values shown here.
    probe_mode: 0
    strip: 0

    # The following fields are optional
    pri_prefix:  string
    description:  string

    Note: for probe_mode, the following modes are available:
      0: no probing
      1: probing only when disabled (however our scripts do not use dr_disable())
      2: probing at all times
    Note: Changes are not applied automatically. Use sip_commands.opensips = "reload routes" to apply the changes.

Note: You do not need to create gateway records for sip_profiles which have an "egress_gwid" field, these are created automatically using the host's sip_domain_name and the egress_gwid. (They will not show up in the database but will be accessible to all the OpenSIPS hosts within that sip_domain_name.)
This feature means that you normally should not have to manually create "gateway"-type records, since all the interesting records should be created automatically.

Note: Changes to rules and gateways are not applied automatically. Use sip_commands.opensips = "reload routes" (or the equivalent portal action) to apply the changes.

## location (provisioning records)

    _id: type+":"+location
    account: string

    type:"location"
    location:  string; a unique identifier for this location
    routing_data:  string; specific to the emergency routing system used
      Note: In France this would be the INSEE code of the commune.


# _users database

The _users database is CouchDB's standard authentication database.

## user records

    _id:"org.couchdb.user:"+name
    type:"user"
    name:  string; the username
    password_sha:  string; sha1_hex(password+salt)
    salt:  string; a random string
    user_database:  string; the name of the user's own CouchDB instance
    roles: [] of string
    domain:  string; name of the domain used at registration time
    profile:
      name:  string; user's full name
      email:  string or array of strings; email or email addresses for this user
      phone:  string; phone number for this user
      userdb_base_uri:  base URI (to which the user_database is concatenated)
      user_name: name
      user_database: user_database

  Notes: This is a standard CouchDB _users record with some additions.
  Notes: The "profile" hash is returned by a GET /u/profile.json once logged-in.
  Notes: The "name" field is normally the user's main email address (at least that's what the registration code assumes); servers and applications will also have _users records so that they can remotely access the main database.
  Notes: Servers should have the "host" role assigned.
  Notes: The roles hash can also be manipulated using the REST API in applications/roles.

## host records

  _id:"org.couchd.user:"+name
  type:"user"
  name:"host@" + hostname
  password_sha
  salt
  roles: ["host"]

# usercode database

This database should only contain design documents which are replicated into each user's private database when the user logs in.

# endpoint-location database

The record in this database are read-only.
(In other words you should not attempt to modify them.)
They are updated by OpenSIPS.

## endpoint-location records

    _id: username+"@"+domain (registration username)
    username: string; username part of the registration username@domain
    domain: string; domain part of the registration username@domain
    # Information received from the client
    callid: string
    contact: string
    cseq: integer
    q: integer (-1 if none is provided by the endpoint)
    user_agent: string
    # Information stored by the server to manage the registration
    last_modified: string (datetime, UTC)
    expires: string (datetime, UTC)
    received: string (IP:port from which the registration packet originated)
    socket: string (IP:port on which we received the registration packet)
    methods: integer
    path: string
    cflags: integer
    flags: 0

# user database

The user database may contain other records replicated from the user database,
the usercode database, the provisioning database.

The following records however are specific to an individual user database and
are not replicated.

## voicemail_settings record

    _id: 'voicemail_settings'
    pin: string of digits; the user's voicemail PIN [optional]
      Note: if no "pin" is specified then no authentication is required to access the voicemail box.
    language: language string for this user's voicemail

    email_notifications: hash; the key is the target email address; the values should be a hash containing:
      attach_message: boolean; if true the voice message is sent along with the notification

    _attachments:
      prompt.wav  voicemail prompt
      name.wav    name prompt

## voicemail records

    _id: type + timestamp + caller_id
    type: 'voicemail'
    timestamp: string; JSON timestamp e.g. "2012-02-13T14:05:21.247Z"
    caller_id: string; caller_id
    box: string; 'new' or 'archive'

    _attachments:
      part1.wav
      part2.wav
      ...       The fragments of the message, in the order they were recorded.
